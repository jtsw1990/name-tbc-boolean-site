                            <p>imo.io is a fun and simple project to allow people to vote anonymously on several
                                popular, and sometimes controversial questions.
                                While we recognize, that most answers lie on a spectrum, everyone has an inclination no
                                matter how slight, and is urged to just go with it.
                                Users can then see the results by country and share them around.

                                No personal or private data is collected or stored apart from your country, and of
                                course the selection.
                                There are no limits on how many times you can vote, and if you feel strongly enough
                                about a certain topic to want to overload my server you are free to do so.

                                If there is a question that you want added in, please go to the contact page and drop me
                                an email, or a message in any of the social media platforms.

                                Future developments include giving you the power to add in your own questions, and a
                                brief comments section. There is also a piece of work to get all the results data published on the github for use.
